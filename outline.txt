Read all words into vec
Select a random one to be the answer in a hashmap
Set the checker equal to an array of 5 Wrongs
Loop until all guesses are used
    Store user input into a hashmap with the keys being the index
    Validate the guess
    Loop through the .zip of the word and answer
        If the letters are equal add Correct to the corresponding index in the checker
            Remove the key-value pair at that index
        Loop through answer
            If the index is not already correct and the letter equals the guess letter add Misplaced to the checker
